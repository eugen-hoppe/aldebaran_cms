A Markdown file is a type of text file that uses a specific syntax to format text. It allows you to create styled documents using a plain text editor. The file extension for markdown files is usually `.md` or `.markdown`. Markdown language uses a variety of special characters such as asterisks (`*`) for bold and italic text, hash signs (`#`) for headings, and hyphens (`-`) for bullet points to format text. 

For example:

### You can create a heading using hash signs (`#`).

One `#` for the largest heading, decreasing in size with more `#` symbols (up to six). Like:

```markdown
# This is a heading 1
## This is a heading 2
```

### You can create bold text 

by wrapping the text in double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`), like: 

```markdawon
**This is bold text**
__This is also bold text__
```

`->` __This is also bold text__

### You can create italic text

by wrapping the text in single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`), like:

```markdown
*This is italic text*
_This is also italic text_
```

`->` _This is also italic text_

### You can create a bullet point list

using asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`), like:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
+ Item 3
- Item 4
```

__Markdown files are often used in website development (particularly in static site generators and documentation), as they are simpler to write and read in a text editor compared to HTML, but can be easily converted to HTML for rendering in web browsers.__
