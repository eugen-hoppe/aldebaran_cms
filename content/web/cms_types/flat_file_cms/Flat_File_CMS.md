### About Flat-File CMS

1. **File-based Storage**: Content is stored in files, often using Markdown format, which offers simple formatting options.
2. **Versioning**: Since all content exists in files, it can be easily managed with versioning systems such as Git.
3. **Speed and Security**: Because no database queries are required, a flat-file CMS can be very fast. It can also potentially be more secure since there is no database that can be targeted for attacks.
4. **Templates and Plugins**: Similar to other CMSs, templates can be used to control the design, and plugins to extend functionality.

### Workflow of a Flat-File CMS:

1. **Content Creation**: Content is created directly on the server or locally, often in a text editor, and then uploaded to the server.
2. **Content Display**: When a visitor accesses a page, the CMS reads the corresponding file, applies the chosen template, and displays the page.
3. **Search Function**: The search can be somewhat more restricted compared to database-driven CMS. However, indexing tools can be used to create an effective search function.
