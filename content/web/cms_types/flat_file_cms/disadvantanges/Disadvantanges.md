### Disadvantages of a Flat-File CMS:

1. **Scalability**: For very large websites, a flat-file CMS might be less suitable as loading times can increase with a growing number of files.
2. **Complexity with Large Amounts of Data**: Managing a large number of files can become cluttered.
3. **Limited Features**: There might be fewer features and extensions compared to a database-driven CMS.
